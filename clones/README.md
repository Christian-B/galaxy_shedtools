The files in the the subdirecties here are clones of packages written by other people.

If using the test or main galaxy toolshed you do not need (and should not use) these.

If using your own toolshed you could use these.

I create fake accounts with the same nickname as the authors of these use on the main galaxy toolshed.
Then loaded the packages using that fake account.
If using that approach alwyas reference the true source.
