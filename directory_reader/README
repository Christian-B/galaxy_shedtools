This tool will lookup files on the Galaxy server machine, including mounted directories.

The user aspects of the tool are explained in the help section of data_reader.xml

Only directories that are included in the white list and not in the black list are allowed.

The white and black lists can be changed without the requirement to restart the server as these are read from the tools install directory each time the tool is run.

====

The white list is tool-data/white-list.ini

Any directory that starts with any entry from this file will be considered to have passed.

The default file includes a single / so all absolute paths will pass.

====

The black list is tool-data/black-list.ini

Any directory that contains any of the blacklisted strings anywhere in the path are excluded.

The default file excludes most of the standard linux systems directories where data is unlikely to be found.

It also excludes the /galaxy/ pattern to avoid users getting access to galaxy files.

Also .. and ~ are excluded for security reasons.
